# Kaggle-Spaceship-Titanic

This repository contains analysis of the Spaceship Titanic disaster from Kaggle. This dataset represents a hypothetical event based on the actual historical Titanic. It is still essentially a classification problem, although in this case some of the passengers have been transported to another dimension. The dataset is part of a [sample competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) with a leaderboard for scoring submissions based on classification accuracy.

(One drawback from classifying a portion of the data from the original Titanic disaster was that since it was a historic event there were records which allowed for determination with perfect accuracy which passengers survived and which did not.)
